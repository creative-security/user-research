# user-research / INTERActor - User Testing

INTERActor is the tool developed partialy during the research project TREsPASS.

Initially designed to allow practitioners to record the actors, relationships and other information gathered during creative led workshops with stakeholders.

## User Testing

There has been some basic user testing of the first protoype of the application. 

This document outlines a test process for the overall journey from creative workshop, into the application and the resulting visualisation and other representations of the actors and relationships and through to the other linked applications such as ANM.

The tests should also cover some of the planned uses and outputs from INTERActor to see if they 'make sense' from the expected user audience.
