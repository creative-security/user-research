# user-research / INTERActor - User Testing

INTERActor is the tool developed partialy during the research project TREsPASS.

Initially designed to allow practitioners to record the actors, relationships and other information gathered during creative led workshops with stakeholders.

## User Testing

There has been some basic user testing of the first protoype of the application. 

This document outlines a test process for the overall journey from creative workshop, into the application and the resulting visualisation and other representations of the actors and relationships and through to the other linked applications such as ANM.

The tests should also cover some of the planned uses and outputs from INTERActor to see if they 'make sense' from the expected user audience.

## A User Journey Described

A typical user, a security practioner, has been asked to look at the risks within a certain organisation, maybe around a specific area of the business. 

In the initial phases of exploration the practioner needs to gather as much information on how the organisation works as they can. 

### Questions:

Does this type of visualisation help you move your thinking on in anyway?
Does it help you to see something different?

Operational Diagrams

How the spreadsheet is used?
Does it make sense?
Do they need freeform names to the columns?

## A new process
1. create a problem space
2. define the problem
3. Create a workshop
4. Define the data that you want to capture from the workshop

We have Actors, Relationships and Groups. Actors can be related to other actors, groups can be related to other groups. Actors can be related to groups, and vice versa.
